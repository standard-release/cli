## Install

This project requires [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org) **^8.10.0 || >=10.13.0** _(see [Support & Release Policy](https://github.com/tunnckoCoreLabs/support-release-policy))_. Install it using
[**yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com) or [**npm**](https://npmjs.com).  
_We highly recommend to use Yarn when you think to contribute to this project._

## CLI

Just run `standard-release` and that's it!
It will detect next needed bump for your package and execute `npm version` and `npm publish`.

Make note that it is meant to be used in CI services, but if you want to run it locally pass
the `--no-ci` flag, otherwise it will exit the program.

```
Usage:
  stanard-release [flags]

Flags:
  --ci          to be called on CI or locally; default: true
  --dry         dry run, won't publish; it will output metadata
  --cwd         a directory where the package.json is; default: process.cwd()
  --token       a npm token to be used, or pass NPM_TOKEN env
  --registry    a npm registry to be published to, or pass NPM_REGISTRY env
